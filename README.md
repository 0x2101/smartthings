## SmartThings Projects

This repository contains open source applications (Smart Apps) and custom
device handlers I have created for the [SmartThings](http://fbuy.me/bb9pe)
home automation system.

* __Dim and Dimmer__ - create lighting scenes triggered by mode changes.
* __Pollster__ - a SmartThings polling daemon.
* __Remind to Lock__ - notify me when a door is left unlocked.
* __VLC Thing__ - a device handler for controlling VLC media player.
