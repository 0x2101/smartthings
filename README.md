## SmartThings Projects

This repository contains applications (SmartApps) and custom device types I have written for the [SmartThings](https://www.smartthings.com) home automation system.

Currently these include:

* __SmartAlarm__ - a multi-zone virtual alarm panel
* __Poller__ - a SmartThings polling daemon
