## SmartThings Projects

This repository contains open source applications (Smart Apps) and custom
device types I have written for the [SmartThings](http://fbuy.me/bb9pe)
home automation system.

Currently these include:

* __Dim and Dimmer__ - create lighting scenes triggered by mode changes
* __Pollster__ - a SmartThings polling daemon
* __Remind to Lock__ - notify me when a door is left unlocked.
