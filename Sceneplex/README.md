Sceneplex
=========

Under construction ...

Sceneplex is a "smart app" for the [SmartThings](http://fbuy.me/bb9pe) home
automation system that allows executing 'Hello, Home' actions using virtual
switches (On/Off buttons). It also provides a web API to allow any web client
to execute 'Hello, Home' actions using HTTP GET requests over the Internet.
